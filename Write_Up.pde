  1. What was your take on the theme of COVID 19? Why?
    The COVID-19 pandemic is an important issue to tackle because it has affected every aspect of our lives since it began earlier this year.
    It has affected the global economy, our ways of interaction with others, our education, our health, and the society as a whole. It left millions
    of people jobless and most importantly miliions of people dead. It has exposed the fragility of humanity and the desire of individuals to appreciate
    their normal lives before the crisis. We need to communicated the ideas about COVID-19 in different forms like in Processing.

  2. How does the form you chose (interactive, for example) support / enable your your ideas?
    I want people to be educated about COVID-19. I want to educate them about how the virus can travel through the air and how fast it can transmit from
    one person to another. I also want them to realize how social distancing and wearing masks can prevent the further spread of the virus.

    
  3. Talk about how your design choices (formal elements such as colour, shape, movement, etc.) support your interpretation of the theme.
    Since it is about COVID-19, much of effort went to the design and implementation of COVID-19 particles. I implemented object-oriented programming
    to design the COVID-19 particles focusing on their color, transparency, dimension, and movement most importantly. I want to show how COVID-19 travels through
    the air and what the actual look of the virus (as seen in the microscope). I also used the COVID-19 object (using inheritance) to demonstrate how people can
    spread the virus by physical contact (SCENE 6). To make it more engaging and educational, I incorporated some instrcutions in every scene alongside with
    text information about COVID-19.

  4. Any challenges you encountered and how you dealt with them.
    The original plan was to develop a full-length obstacle game where the player has to dodge or avoid touching the COVID-19 particles scattered around. The plan
    was changed because of my other school requirements that required more time to finish (I have another programming project due by the end of the semester).
    I only had less than four days to finish this Processing project. If given a chance, I will improve and add more scenes to the project.
    
  5. Did your project change much along the way? If so, why?
    The project changed from being a full-length game into an interactive-animative, educational program. The change was because of my other school requirements
    that require more time to finish.
