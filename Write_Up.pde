  1. What was your take on the theme of COVID 19? Why?
    The COVID-19 pandemic is an important issue to tackle because it has affected every aspect of our lives since it began earlier this year.
    It has impacted the global economy, our ways of interacting with others, our education, our health, and the society as a whole. It left millions
    of people jobless and, most importantly, millions of people dead. It has exposed the fragility of humanity and the appreciation of individuals on
    their normal lives before the crisis. We need to communicate the ideas about COVID-19 in different forms like in Processing.

  2. How does the form you chose (interactive, for example) support / enable your ideas?
    I want people to be educated about COVID-19. I want to educate them about how the virus can travel through the air and how fast it can transmit from
    one person to another. I also want them to realize how social distancing and wearing masks can prevent the further spread of the virus. One way to
    educate the people is by giving them information or facts about COVID-19 through an interactive program like this project.

    
  3. Talk about how your design choices (formal elements such as colour, shape, movement, etc.) support your interpretation of the theme.
    Since it is about COVID-19, much of effort went to the design and implementation of COVID-19 particles. I implemented object-oriented programming
    to design the COVID-19 particles - focusing on their color, transparency, dimension, and movement. I want to show how COVID-19 travels through
    the air and what it looks like. I also used the COVID-19 object (using inheritance) to demonstrate how people can
    spread the virus by physical contact (SCENE 6). To make it more engaging and educational, I incorporated some instructions in every scene alongside with
    text information about COVID-19.

  4. Any challenges you encountered and how you dealt with them.
    The original plan was to develop a full-length obstacle game where the player has to dodge or avoid touching the COVID-19 particles scattered around. The plan
    was changed because of my other school requirements that required more time to finish (I have other programming projects due by the end of the semester).
    I only had less than four days to finish this Processing project. If given a chance, I will improve and add more scenes to it.
    
  5. Did your project change much along the way? If so, why?
    The project changed from being a full-length game into an interactive-animative, educational program. The change was because of my other school requirements
    that require more time to finish.
